Bootstrap provides a list of the [available icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/#icons). Icons is a method using the IconTypes enumerator to render a specified icon. The default size rendered is 32x32, unless specified.

### Web Component

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/gd-sprest-bs-wc/dist/gd-sprest-bs-icons.js"></script>

The icons haven't been incorporated with the web component library. This will be done in future builds.
